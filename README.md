# Java-Project

This is bank interface in which  Java is used in the backend, netbeans in the frontend, and we used SQL for database management.
Here user can register and login to arrive in main page where he can see his profile and can update it.
He can do transactions within bank with different accounts and can see his account history.
Admin can see all the information of all users and can add money in accounts. So basically int this case admin acts like ATM machine.
